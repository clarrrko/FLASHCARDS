  // RISK AVERSION & UTILITY
  { question: "What is speculation?", answer: "Taking investment risk for a risk premium." },
  { question: "What is gambling in finance?", answer: "Taking risk for enjoyment, with no risk premium." },
  { question: "What is a fair game?", answer: "A risky investment with zero expected gain (zero risk premium)." },
  { question: "What is the utility function for risky investments?", answer: "U = E(r) - (1/2) × A × σ²" },
  { question: "What does A represent in the utility function?", answer: "Risk aversion coefficient (higher A = more risk-averse)." },
  { question: "How does risk affect utility?", answer: "More risk lowers utility for risk-averse investors." },
  { question: "Who prefers risky portfolios: A=2 or A=4?", answer: "A=2, less risk-averse, prefers more risk for return." },

  // CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISION
  { question: "What is the capital allocation decision?", answer: "How much to invest in risky vs. risk-free assets." },
  { question: "Formula for complete portfolio return?", answer: "rC = y × rP + (1 - y) × rF" },
  { question: "Formula for expected return of complete portfolio?", answer: "E(rC) = rF + y × [E(rP) - rF]" },
  { question: "Formula for complete portfolio risk?", answer: "σC = y × σP" },
  { question: "What is the Capital Allocation Line (CAL)?", answer: "Line showing risk-return combinations of risky/risk-free portfolio mixes." },
  { question: "Formula for slope of CAL?", answer: "S = [E(rP) - rF] / σP (Sharpe Ratio)" },

  // CAL & SHARPE EXAMPLES
  { question: "If rF = 7%, E(rP) = 15%, σP = 22%, what's the Sharpe Ratio?", answer: "S = (15 - 7) / 22 = 0.36" },
  { question: "For y = 0.5, what is E(rC)?", answer: "E(rC) = 7% + 0.5 × 8% = 11%" },
  { question: "For y = 0.5, what is σC?", answer: "σC = 0.5 × 22% = 11%" },
  { question: "What happens when y > 1?", answer: "Investor is borrowing to invest more in risky assets." },
  { question: "Why is the CAL kinked?", answer: "Borrowing rate > lending rate → slope of CAL changes beyond point P." },

  // OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO CHOICE
  { question: "How do you find the optimal y allocation?", answer: "y* = [E(rP) - rF] / (A × σ²P)" },
  { question: "If A = 4, rF = 7%, E(rP) = 15%, σP = 22%, what's y*?", answer: "y* = (15 - 7) / (4 × 0.222) = 0.41" },
  { question: "If A = 3, what's the new y*?", answer: "y* = (15 - 7) / (3 × 0.222) = 0.55" },
  { question: "What is the investor's utility-maximizing portfolio?", answer: "The portfolio on the CAL that touches the highest indifference curve." },

  // INDIFFERENCE CURVES
  { question: "What is an indifference curve in this context?", answer: "Set of portfolios with equal utility (U)." },
  { question: "What shape does an indifference curve take when A > 0?", answer: "Convex (increasing risk requires higher E(r))." },
  { question: "What is the preferred region on a risk-return plot?", answer: "Northwest (↑ return, ↓ risk)." },

  // PASSIVE STRATEGY & CML
  { question: "What is a passive investment strategy?", answer: "Combining T-Bills and a broad market index like the S&P 500, no security selection." },
  { question: "What is the Capital Market Line (CML)?", answer: "CAL created by combining risk-free asset and the market portfolio under CAPM." },
  { question: "What assumption does the CML rely on?", answer: "That all investors have access to the same market portfolio and risk-free rate." }
