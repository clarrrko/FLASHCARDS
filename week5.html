const flashcards = [
  // Week 5 Part 1 — Two Risky Assets
  { question: "What are the 3 layers in the top-down portfolio approach?", answer: "1. Capital allocation (risky vs risk-free), 2. Asset allocation within risky, 3. Security selection" },
  { question: "What is specific risk?", answer: "Risk tied to firm-specific factors; also called diversifiable or non-systematic risk." },
  { question: "What is market risk?", answer: "Risk affecting all securities, e.g., inflation, recessions. It is non-diversifiable/systematic." },
  { question: "What happens when correlation ρ = +1 between assets?", answer: "No diversification benefit — portfolio risk equals weighted average of individual risks." },
  { question: "What happens when ρ = 0?", answer: "No correlation: diversification reduces risk significantly." },
  { question: "What happens when ρ = -1?", answer: "Perfect negative correlation: portfolio risk can be reduced to zero." },
  { question: "Portfolio variance for 2 risky assets?", answer: "σ²P = w²Dσ²D + w²Eσ²E + 2wDwEρDEσDσE" },
  { question: "Perfect positive correlation (ρ = 1): what is σP?", answer: "σP = wDσD + wEσE (no diversification benefit)" },
  { question: "Perfect negative correlation: weights for σP = 0?", answer: "wD = σE / (σD + σE), wE = σD / (σD + σE)" },
  { question: "Message from correlation table?", answer: "Lower correlation → higher diversification benefit." },

  // Week 5 Part 2 — Complete Portfolio
  { question: "Expected return formula with weights wD, wE?", answer: "E(rP) = 0.08wD + 0.13wE" },
  { question: "Variance formula for ρ = 0.3?", answer: "σ²P = 0.0144w²D + 0.04w²E + 2×0.3×0.12×0.20wDwE" },
  { question: "Minimum variance portfolio example result?", answer: "wD = 0.82, wE = 0.18, E(rP) = 8.9%, σP = 11.45%" },
  { question: "Effect of decreasing correlation on risk?", answer: "Lower correlation reduces total portfolio risk." },
  { question: "What does CAL stand for?", answer: "Capital Allocation Line" },
  { question: "Sharpe ratio formula?", answer: "Sharpe = (E(rP) - rF) / σP" },
  { question: "CAL(A) vs CAL(B) comparison?", answer: "CAL(B) dominates A — higher Sharpe ratio." },
  { question: "What is the optimal risky portfolio P?", answer: "The portfolio on the risky asset frontier that is tangent to the highest possible CAL." },
  { question: "How to find optimal risky portfolio?", answer: "Maximize Sharpe ratio: max S = (E(rP) - rF)/σP" },
  { question: "Resulting optimal weights from example?", answer: "wD = 0.4, wE = 0.6" },
  { question: "E(rP) and σP for optimal portfolio?", answer: "E(rP) = 11%, σP = 14.2%, Sharpe = 0.42" },
  { question: "What is the 'complete' portfolio?", answer: "Combination of risk-free asset + optimal risky portfolio P." },
  { question: "What determines the optimal complete portfolio?", answer: "Investor’s degree of risk aversion (utility function)." },
  { question: "Markowitz Step 1: Frontier?", answer: "Identify minimum variance frontier for risky assets." },
  { question: "What is the efficient frontier?", answer: "Portfolios above global minimum variance that offer best risk-return tradeoff." },
  { question: "Markowitz Step 2: Optimal risky portfolio?", answer: "Find portfolio with steepest CAL — highest Sharpe ratio." },
  { question: "Markowitz Step 3: Optimal complete portfolio?", answer: "Mix of F and P that maximizes utility." },
  { question: "What is the Separation Property?", answer: "Portfolio choice splits into (1) finding optimal risky portfolio (same for all) and (2) selecting allocation (investor specific)." }
