const flashcards = [
  // Risk and Return Basics
  { question: "What does a 'safe pound is worth more than a risky pound' mean?", answer: "Investors prefer certainty; risky payoffs should be discounted more heavily." },
  { question: "What is the formula for Present Value with risk?", answer: "PV = C1 / (1 + r + α)" },
  { question: "How do you calculate expected payoff?", answer: "E(C) = Σ(Cs × ps), where Cs is cash flow in state s, ps is probability." },
  { question: "What is Holding Period Return (HPR)?", answer: "HPR = (P1 - P0 + DIV1) / P0" },
  { question: "How do you calculate expected return?", answer: "E(r) = Σ(rs × ps)" },

  // Expected Return Example
  { question: "What is the expected return from the Boom/Normal/Recession example?", answer: "E(r) = 0.3×0.34 + 0.5×0.14 + 0.2×(-0.16) = 14%" },

  // Risk & Variance
  { question: "What is standard deviation (σ) used for?", answer: "It measures risk as the dispersion of returns." },
  { question: "What is variance of returns?", answer: "σ² = Σ[(rs - E(r))² × ps] or E(r²) - E(r)²" },

  // Risk-Free Rate and Premium
  { question: "What is the risk-free rate?", answer: "Return on assets with minimal risk, e.g., short-term T-bills." },
  { question: "What is risk premium?", answer: "E(r) - rf (expected return minus risk-free rate)" },

  // Historical Returns
  { question: "How do we estimate expected return using historical data?", answer: "E(r) = Σ(rs) / n = arithmetic average" },
  { question: "How is historical variance estimated?", answer: "σ² = Σ(rs - r̄)² / n" },

  // Skewness and Kurtosis
  { question: "What is skewness?", answer: "A measure of asymmetry in a distribution." },
  { question: "What is kurtosis?", answer: "A measure of 'peakedness' and tail risk." },

  // Portfolio Return
  { question: "How is expected portfolio return calculated?", answer: "E(RP) = Σ(xi × E(Ri))" },
  { question: "Portfolio example: 60% Southwest (15%), 40% Amazon (10%)?", answer: "E(RP) = 0.6×15% + 0.4×10% = 13%" },

  // Portfolio Risk & Correlation
  { question: "What affects portfolio risk?", answer: "Individual risks and correlation between assets." },
  { question: "Formula for portfolio variance (2 assets)?", answer: "σ²P = x²Aσ²A + x²Bσ²B + 2xAxBρABσAσB" },

  // Diversification
  { question: "What is diversification?", answer: "Reducing risk by investing across different assets." },
  { question: "How does correlation affect diversification?", answer: "Lower correlation reduces risk more effectively." },
  { question: "What is systematic risk?", answer: "Market-wide risk that cannot be diversified away." },
  { question: "What is idiosyncratic risk?", answer: "Asset-specific risk that can be diversified away." },

  // Diversification Example
  { question: "When ρ = 1, what happens to diversification?", answer: "No risk reduction — portfolio risk equals weighted average." },
  { question: "When ρ = -1, what happens?", answer: "Perfect diversification — risk can be eliminated completely." },

  // Variance with Many Stocks
  { question: "What is the variance formula for a portfolio of n equal-weight stocks?", answer: "σ²P = (1/n)×AvgVariance + (1 - 1/n)×AvgCovariance" },

  // Beta and Market Risk
  { question: "What is beta (β)?", answer: "Measure of a stock’s sensitivity to market movements." },
  { question: "How is beta calculated?", answer: "βi = Cov(ri, rm) / Var(rm) = ρi,M × (σi / σM)" },
  { question: "What does β > 1 mean?", answer: "Stock is more volatile than the market (aggressive)." },
  { question: "What does β < 1 mean?", answer: "Stock is less volatile than the market (defensive)." },

  // Risk-Return Tradeoff
  { question: "What is the Security Market Line (SML)?", answer: "Graph showing expected return vs beta — CAPM’s linear relationship." }
