  { question: "Name two broad categories of behavioural irrationalities.", answer: "1. Misprocessing of information, 2. Suboptimal decision-making given information." },
  { question: "What is limited attention in finance?", answer: "Investors may miss or underreact to important information due to time or cognitive constraints." },
  { question: "What is overconfidence?", answer: "Overestimation of one's forecasting abilities or information accuracy." },
  { question: "What is conservatism bias?", answer: "Slow adjustment of beliefs in response to new evidence." },
  { question: "What is representativeness bias?", answer: "Overreliance on small or recent samples to make predictions." },
  { question: "What is framing in behavioural finance?", answer: "Decisions vary based on how options are presented." },

  { question: "What is regret avoidance?", answer: "Avoiding nontraditional decisions to minimize future regret." },
  { question: "What is 'affect' in investment decisions?", answer: "Choosing emotionally appealing assets, often overpaying and underperforming." },

  // Prospect Theory
  { question: "What does Prospect Theory suggest about risk?", answer: "Investors are risk-averse for gains, but risk-seeking for losses." },

  // Limits to Arbitrage
  { question: "Why can't arbitrageurs always correct mispricing?", answer: "Due to risks, transaction costs, and short-selling restrictions." },
  { question: "What is fundamental risk?", answer: "Risk that a mispriced asset becomes more mispriced before correcting." },
  { question: "What is model risk?", answer: "The risk that the arbitrageur's valuation model is incorrect." },
  { question: "What is the Royal Dutch and Shell example used for?", answer: "Illustrates limits to arbitrage due to prolonged pricing deviation." },

  // Technical Analysis
  { question: "What is technical analysis?", answer: "Trading strategy using past prices and volume to predict future movements." },
  { question: "Why does technical analysis work under behavioural finance?", answer: "Price patterns may reflect behavioural biases and sentiment." },
  { question: "What is a moving average?", answer: "The average of past prices over a window, used to identify trends." },
  { question: "What signals do moving averages generate?", answer: "Bullish: price crosses above moving average; Bearish: crosses below." },
  { question: "What is relative strength?", answer: "The ratio of a stock’s price to a benchmark index, showing out/underperformance." },
  { question: "What is breadth in technical analysis?", answer: "The number of stocks advancing vs declining — wider participation strengthens signals." },
  { question: "What is the Trin statistic?", answer: "Volume declining/decliners ÷ volume advancing/advancers — above 1 is bearish." },
  { question: "What is the Confidence Index?", answer: "Top-rated bond yields ÷ intermediate-rated bond yields — higher values = bullish." }
