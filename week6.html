const flashcards = [
  // CAPM Theory
  { question: "Why is the Markowitz model hard to use in practice?", answer: "Requires huge number of estimates — means, variances, and thousands of covariances." },
  { question: "What does CAPM aim to solve?", answer: "It simplifies portfolio optimization by relating returns to systematic risk only." },
  { question: "What does CAPM assume about investors?", answer: "All investors hold the same mean-variance efficient portfolio (the market portfolio)." },
  { question: "What is the CAPM expected return equation?", answer: "E(r) = rF + β × [E(rM) - rF]" },
  { question: "What does beta measure in CAPM?", answer: "The stock’s sensitivity to the market portfolio — systematic risk." },
  { question: "How does CAPM define the Security Market Line (SML)?", answer: "A graph showing the relationship between expected return and beta." },
  { question: "What does it mean if a stock lies above the SML?", answer: "It's underpriced — offers more return than predicted by CAPM." },
  { question: "How is Jensen's alpha calculated?", answer: "Alpha = Actual expected return - CAPM predicted return" },
  { question: "What does a positive alpha mean?", answer: "The asset is underpriced and could offer abnormal returns." },

  // CAPM Application & Limits
  { question: "Name 3 applications of CAPM.", answer: "1. Estimating cost of capital, 2. Asset valuation, 3. Portfolio performance measurement." },
  { question: "What's Roll's Critique of CAPM?", answer: "CAPM can't be properly tested unless we observe the true market portfolio, which is impossible." },
  { question: "What did Fama and French find?", answer: "Size and value factors add explanatory power to beta." },

  // APT - Arbitrage Pricing Theory
  { question: "How does APT differ from CAPM?", answer: "APT allows for multiple factors driving returns, not just the market portfolio." },
  { question: "APT Single Factor Model Equation?", answer: "Rit = αi + βiMRMt + εit" },
  { question: "APT Assumption about residuals?", answer: "Residuals (εit) are uncorrelated across assets." },
  { question: "Why is αi → 0 in large portfolios?", answer: "Diversification eliminates idiosyncratic risk; any αi ≠ 0 means arbitrage opportunity." },
  { question: "APT Multifactor Model Equation?", answer: "rit = E(ri) + ΣβikFkt + εit" },
  { question: "What are Fkt in the multifactor model?", answer: "Shocks to macroeconomic or systematic factors (e.g., GDP, interest rates)." },
  { question: "How is expected return expressed in APT?", answer: "E(ri) = rF + Σβikλk" },
  { question: "What is λk in APT?", answer: "Price of risk for the k-th factor (risk premium)." },

  // APT - Factor Examples
  { question: "What are some macro factors used in APT (Chen, Roll, Ross)?", answer: "IP (Industrial Production), EI (Expected Inflation), UI (Unanticipated Inflation), CG (Corporate-Gov bond spread), GB (Gov bond - T-bill)." },
  { question: "What are Fama-French factors?", answer: "SMB (Size), HML (Value)" },
  { question: "Why doesn't APT specify which factors to use?", answer: "APT is flexible — factors are chosen based on empirical significance." },

  // APT vs CAPM
  { question: "Key difference between CAPM and APT?", answer: "CAPM uses one market factor; APT allows multiple risk factors." },
  { question: "How are both models similar?", answer: "Both assume no arbitrage and use betas to relate risk to expected return." },
  { question: "Which model is easier to test empirically?", answer: "APT — because it doesn't rely on an unobservable market portfolio." }
