  // Conventional Performance Evaluation
  { question: "What is the arithmetic average return?", answer: "Sum of returns over periods divided by number of periods." },
  { question: "What is the geometric average return?", answer: "The constant return that gives the same total return over the entire period. Also called time-weighted average." },
  { question: "What is the difference between time-weighted and dollar-weighted returns?", answer: "Time-weighted ignores cash flows; dollar-weighted accounts for cash added/withdrawn." },
  { question: "What is the internal rate of return (IRR)?", answer: "The return that equates the present value of inflows and outflows — dollar-weighted return." },

  // Risk Adjustment & Performance Measures
  { question: "What is the Sharpe Ratio?", answer: "Sharpe = (rP − rF) / σP — excess return per unit of total risk." },
  { question: "What is the Treynor Measure?", answer: "Treynor = (rP − rF) / βP — excess return per unit of systematic risk." },
  { question: "What is Jensen's Alpha?", answer: "Alpha = rP − [rF + βP(rM − rF)] — actual return minus CAPM-predicted return." },
  { question: "What is the Information Ratio?", answer: "IR = Alpha / Nonsystematic risk — abnormal return per unit of tracking error." },

  // Example Question
  { question: "If rP = 35%, rM = 28%, βP = 1.2, σP = 42%, σ(eP) = 18%, rF = 6%, calculate Sharpe Ratio.", answer: "Sharpe = (35% - 6%) / 42% = 0.69" },
  { question: "Same example: Treynor?", answer: "Treynor = (35% - 6%) / 1.2 = 24.2%" },
  { question: "Same example: Jensen’s Alpha?", answer: "Alpha = 35% - [6% + 1.2×(28%-6%)] = 2.6%" },
  { question: "Same example: Information Ratio?", answer: "IR = 2.6% / 18% = 0.144" },

  // Hypothetical Portfolio Measures
  { question: "What is the M² measure?", answer: "Return of a portfolio adjusted to match the volatility of the benchmark." },
  { question: "What is the T² measure?", answer: "Return of a portfolio adjusted to match the beta of the benchmark." },

  // M² & T² Calculation
  { question: "If σP = 20%, σM = 24%, rP = 16%, rM = 14%, rF = 6%, what is M²?", answer: "M² = [1.2×16% - 0.2×6%] - 14% = 4%" },
  { question: "Same example: what is T² (β = 0.8)?", answer: "T² = [1.25×16% - 0.25×6%] - 14% = 4.5%" },

  // Choosing the Right Measure
  { question: "When should Sharpe ratio be used?", answer: "When portfolio is the full investment." },
  { question: "When is Treynor ratio more appropriate?", answer: "When portfolio is part of a larger diversified fund." },
  { question: "When is Information Ratio useful?", answer: "When comparing active portfolios to a benchmark." },

  // Advanced Evaluation - Style Analysis
  { question: "What is style analysis?", answer: "A regression-based method to estimate a fund’s exposure to asset class indexes." },
  { question: "What does R² measure in style analysis?", answer: "Proportion of return variance explained by style." },
  { question: "What does the regression intercept capture?", answer: "The alpha due to security selection." },

  // Changing Portfolio Composition
  { question: "Why is changing composition an issue in evaluation?", answer: "Assumes constant risk, but managers may shift beta or volatility over time." },
  { question: "What is the result of ignoring changing portfolio composition?", answer: "Sharpe ratio may mislead if portfolio strategy changes mid-period." },

  // Market Timing
  { question: "What is market timing?", answer: "Adjusting exposure to market based on expected performance." },
  { question: "What is the Treynor-Mazuy timing model?", answer: "rP − rF = a + b(rM − rF) + c(rM − rF)² + eP; c > 0 indicates timing ability." },
  { question: "What is the Henriksson-Merton timing model?", answer: "rP − rF = a + b(rM − rF) + c(rM − rF)D + eP, where D is 1 when rM − rF > 0." },

  // Performance Attribution
  { question: "What is performance attribution?", answer: "Breaking performance into contributions from allocation, sector selection, and security selection." },
  { question: "What is a bogey portfolio?", answer: "A benchmark portfolio constructed using passive strategies to compare manager performance." },
  { question: "Why is attribution important?", answer: "Helps identify whether outperformance comes from allocation, selection, or sector bets." }
